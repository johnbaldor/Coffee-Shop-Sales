This program reads data off text files and stores it in an array. Each text file contains the monthly sales for items of a coffee shop. Once it has the data, it prompts the user to enter a value to either see the monthly sales of an item, get a file containing the yearly sales of each item, or get the item with the most sales all year. 


To compile the program, run the command:
gcc coffee_shop.c register.c -o register


To run the program, run the command:
./register
And then enter a number when prompted
